      <p class="w3-justify w3-col m7 w3-right w3-padding ">My name is Tran Thi Thuy Tien, and my student ID is 3825458. Presently, I am majoring in Human Resources Management (HRM) at RMIT university. I am an extrovert that really enjoys making new friends, therefore, I joined many clubs, such as RMIT Human Development Club which enables me to develop interpersonal skills and meet friends who share mutual interests. My enjoyment for IT started when I attended an online event that focused on how IT will affect HRM in the future. That’s when I realized the importance of technical skill and data analysis if I want to succeed with my future career path. Moreover, our team’s name is related to two of my interests right now: business and IT - with a desire to create and support other businesses with IT solutions in the future.

Therefore, RMIT is my destination as its Digital Marketing degree integrates both academic and hands-on practice excellently. Another reason I study Digital Marketing is because I always have a soft spot for technology, which explains why I chose a major which combines both marketing and technology. I consider myself as a creative yet logical person as well as a quick and diligent learner who is not afraid to embrace changes. Besides studying, I also applied for several jobs to nurture skills and knowledge. One of my proudest jobs is working as an intern for a famous Digital & Creative Marketing agency, in which I had the opportunity to collaborate with co-workers to use digital platforms and technology to support marketing strategies such as design, develop and code website, produce and render video, etc. The 6-month internship has fueled my motivation to explore more about the IT world, as I acknowledge marketing without technology will fail to impress the consumers and influence their buying behaviour. By enrolling in this course, I hope to broaden my knowledge about IT knowledge and its application in our daily lives.</p>

Currently, I am a final year student in RMIT with a major in Logistics & Supply chain management. I define myself as an outgoing and energetic person; besides, I am an progesstive person This could be illustrated clearly through my participation in two student clubs which are AIESEC and RMIT Business Club when I am a first-year student. Talking about my IT preference, I am super interested in neural networks and artificial intelligence (AI) in the IT industry. This interest originated from a “Business IT” course in RMIT in which I was given an assignment to research deeply about the application of demand planning in a furniture enterprise. Therefore, that assignment actually triggered my interest in how demand forecasting and demand sensing are applied in many industries in daily life. Since I still do not have any IT experience, I am trying my best to absorb more IT knowledge through the provision of IT-related courses on LinkedIn library or Cousera before having a chance to step into the IT working industry.

With that ID, every student can access every facility in RMIT. Since the second semester of 2021 ended, I started exploring and designing my career path during semester break. During the first week of semester break, I intentionally watched the video of Tinh Te’s workshop discussing the Data Analytics career path. Although I have not approached Information Technology before, I find it interesting, especially the Data aspect. Therefore, I am preparing to become a Business Analyst.

I'm an Introvert and Extrovert person. It implies that between working with a team as in surface, I also spend time reflecting on my work, which I believe will help a lot in the group. Otherwise, I'm a Tactile learner who's willing to dive into the project more than just discussing a subject. Especially in IT, consulting and ready theory to find a solution are just not enough. Digging while doing something is the best way to find the error and directly fix it. Therefore, it could be a positive trait for me to work in a team. Finally, the openness score shows me as a person that thinks in a sophisticated and complex idea. However, I think it could be a good point in teamwork. With a broad way of thinking, I can gather all of the necessary information for the work.

      <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">DETAILED DESCRTIPTION</h2>
      <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">1.Overview</h2>
    
        <span><strong>Topic</strong></span>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">The concept of our project is collected from the idea of assignment 1 of Tien and Chau, two of our members. In the first assignment, Tien offered an app that would provide home training routines and healthy meals to people who cannot afford gym memberships, allowing them to lose weight at home rather than visiting public locations, which could be dangerous in the event of a COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, Chau has developed a platform called 'Smart Health Prediction,' which allows patients to input their health issues so that AI can forecast their existing disease status and provide relevant advice.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">However, because the field of health care encompasses a wide range of diseases, and we lack knowledge in that area. Therefore, we decided to focus our efforts on obesity. Our app will have two unique features: the 3D image feature will scan the user's body and predict which muscle groups need to be improved, and the Artificial Intelligence feature will automatically calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) - a weight-to-height ratio that can be used to determine whether a person is overweight or underweight - based on the users' current weight and height input.</h6><br>

        <br>

  


      <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">5.Scope and Limits</h2>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">A scope of work (SOW) of a project is important as it defines what will be included as a part of our project and what is not, and also the boundaries of the project (Toucan 2020). Therefore, the Business IT team will provide a specific scope statement about the purpose of this project, what we want to create and how to accomplish it.</h6><br>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">Overall, this project is to create a mobile application - which can be functioned on both iOS and Android mobile devices - to raise awareness about doing workout and obesity. For better illustration of how our mobile application will help Vietnamese people, we have built our desired product's prototype on Figma. To know more about login function, the app's settings, etc please visit this link:</h6><br>

      <h6 class="w3-justify">The project will produces four main different features that strongly motivates Vietnamese to move and not being inactive: body scanning, meal planning, BMI calculation and automatical exercises suggested. In particular, one more feature is considered to be developed in the future - building a fitness community on the application.</h6><br>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">1. Body Scanning (3D technology): users will turn on their front camera of smartphones to scan their body shapes, with some simple movement - so that the technology can scan different angles and produce digital body models that represent the user's body shapes. Moreover, users can zoom in, zoom out, rotate to identify which part of their body contains the most fat. There will also be a historical data section - where users can keep track of their progress by comparing their past, current and future body shapes.

      <h6 class="w3-justify">2. BMI Calculator (AI Technology): our app will collect the Body Mass Index (BMI) of users to assess the probability of overweight through two ways:</h6><br>
      <li>Users will manually input their weight/ height and the system will automatically calculate the BMI for further comparison.</h6><br>
      <li>Secondly, users can use the BMI via facial recognition - this function will also utilise the 3D technology to scan the facial image that users have put in - to identify the BMI through the user's </h6>

      <img src="UI facial.JPG" class="w3-right w3-square" alt="IT picture" style="width:50%">
      
      <h6 class="w3-justify">3. Propose suitable exercise plan (AI technology): based on the BMI and scanned image of the user's body, some suggested exercise will be listed out for users to choose. This is because each type of body will have a particular type of exercise. For instance, there is a men user that weighed 80kg - which is overweight, he can not practice the High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) because this type of exercise will require him to do a lot of jumping to burn fat. However, the overweight body will create pressure on his knees that could cause injuries, therefore, a different exercise plan must be suggested and provided for him to achieve his goal of losing weight. </h6><br>

      <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">8.Timeframe</h2>
=======
      <h6 class="w3-justify">4. Meal planning (AI technology): according to our research, in order to lose weight, a suitable exercise is not enough, and a reasonable meal planning is very important (NHS n.d.). The most important principle for a person who wants to lose weight is they must control their “calories in smaller than calories out” - it means we have to eat less calories and move more. Therefore, our app will enable users to input the amount of food they are going to eat, and the app will calculate the calories equivalent to that amount of food - so that users can easily track their calorie intake. </h6><br>

      <img src="UI meall.JPG" class="w3-right w3-square" alt="IT picture" style="width:50%">
      <h6 class="w3-justify">5. Fitness communities (still-in-consideration function): based on psychological research about physical excercise, people tend to enjoy their activities when they are doing it with a group of friends, or a community that shares the same interests, rather than taking exercise alone (Edwards 2003). Therefore, we aim to create a function that is like a social platform, where users can share their milestones, achievements in terms of fitness and sport, or find a friend that motivates and encourages them to take physical activity. </h6><br>

      <h6 class="w3-justify">Besides, our target audience is people who are struggling with being overweight but do not know where to start, or students, adults who have low income that can not afford gym membership fees to download our application as a real coach for their exercise target. </h6>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">With each of the features, the Business IT team will carefully manage the process and problems, with tools to track the progress and productive collaboration in order to satisfy future stakeholders. However, we consider the body scanning feature using the 3D technology would be a time-consuming process for the team that have just started to study about IT, lacking formal knowledge like the Business IT team. According to Golovnya (2020), in order to create the three-dimensional scanning, the team must take into account the C++ for application development, or working on 3D rendering time, etc. However, none of us have ever tried C++ programming, while 3D rendering is a memory intensive process that would be time-consuming for beginners like the Business IT team - about 1-2 months for a beginner to learn about the process before starting out (Snellen 2021). Besides limited human resources, there is also limited time for building this application (which will be analyzed in the time frame section). Therefore, the 3D body scanning function is showing the risk of uncertainty, while the three other functions using AI technology will be examined and implemented for the user interface of the team’s application, but with minimum ability and the team will try to gradually remove bugs, software updates, etc. </h6><br>
      <li>Limitations:
      <h6 class="w3-justify">1. Technical knowledge limitations:</h6>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">As stated above, the Business IT team members are all freshmen when it comes to the field of IT, therefore, the technical knowledge such as coding, fixing bugs, etc still have not fully comprehended by the team members, mainly due to time constraint. Therefore, in order to complete our project idea, members in the team have to continue research and analyse the UI & UX design, device compatibility, PR and digital marketing, etc to successfully launch this application. Without a proper plan of learning about programming language, the team could end up losing so much time, effort and all the fascinating expectation is drained out of it.</h6><br>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">2. Design limitations: </h6>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">The screen size of websites and mobile applications is very different from each other: the mobile screen is much smaller than PC or laptop screen, and also the pointing tool is not the same size (for mobile applications is the user's finger, which is much larger than the mouse pointer of PC or laptop). During the process of buidling UI & UX strategy of the Business IT team, the screen resolution, pixel densities, etc is estimated to be time-consuming because we will have to conduct application test over and over again until the application is fit the screen efficiency standard, or until the application is not gobble-up too much battery power of the phone. Thus, we are intending to seek support from other professional mobile application developers - to save time for building this project and avoid faulty functionality. </h6><br>

>>>>>>> bcfeacf170aa3a9f23a44230f7c64e74e4464415

      <h6 class="w3-justify">After submitting assignment 2, our team started spending the last 4 weeks of this semester working on the last assignment, which includes a report, a website demo on Github and a presentation. Because this is a group project, we all decided that everyone will be involved in all the tasks, starting from meetings to finalizing the report, demo website and presentation slides. By doing this, all teammates can understand the assignment’s requirements, the purpose of our project idea and how it will be executed in real-life. Furthermore, we want to strengthen the collaboration among team members and hope that everyone can contribute equally to the final result.</h6><br>

      <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">9.Risks</h2>
      
      <p>Poor UX/ UI integration</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Cause
          <ul>
            <li>UI: not enough research go into the wireframe development that leads to unfriendly-user interface, lack of aesthetic attraction and hard for users to navigate lack</li>
            <li>UX: Wrong choice of the servers, data diagrams, APIs that leads to poor functionality</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Solution
          <ul>
            <li>UI: keep the app’s design simple, interactive with easy-to-absorb and consistent content. This could be solved by doing thorough research about the target audience to understand which features, functions they need from the moment they start logging our app until they get the needed data to help manage weight.</li>
            <li>UX: be careful when building the wireframe that correctly maps to each stage of the customer journey, test several times before final releasing</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Unreliable content</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Cause
          <ul>
            <li>With many misleading articles on the Internet, each piece of content published on the app needs to be accurate and reliable for users to follow. For example, outdated diet plans that adversely affect health should be avoided</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Solution
          <ul>
            <li>Careful research about human’s health in general</li>
            <li>Follow WHO’s data as a standard information for credibility</li>
            <li>Take reference from nutritionists, doctors, health advisors, personal trainers when suggesting meal recipes and exercise plans</li>

            <li>UX: be careful when building the wireframe that correctly maps to each stage of the customer journey, test several times before final releasing</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Inaccurate body scanner</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Cause
          <ul>
            <li> wrong measurements resulted from the user's position and whether they are placing the back camera correctly, as well as technical issues might occur.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Solution
          <ul>
            <li>Providing informative and easy guidance with demo video showing users how to self-scan at home and how to interpret BMI ratios appeared after scanning.</li>
            <li>Implementing preventive application maintenance to help ensure data security</li>
            <li>Use simple-to-understand functions to enhance personalized monitoring to increase ease of use and boost users’ experience</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Security violation</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Cause
          <ul>
            <li>Implementing unauthorized data storage systems, databases, inadequate encryption algorithms that are easy to be hacked. As people’s health is a sensitive issue, poor choice of user data protection can lead to an exposure of data to third parties for illegal purposes.</li>
            <li>Inadequate IT knowledge when choosing security technologies</li>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Solution
          <ul>
            <li>Understand thoroughly about privacy guidelines from Vietnamese government and invest in the most innovative security technologies</li>
            <li>Have a section about data policy and be transparent about how users’ data will be used</li>
            <li>Give users control over data the app collects</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Inadequate knowledge & skills</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Cause
          <ul>
            <li>Wrong measurements resulted from the user's position and whether they are placing the back camera correctly, as well as technical issues might occur</li>

          </ul>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Inadequate knowledge & skills</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Cause
          <ul>
            <li>This weight control mobile application integrates both 3D technology, AI and complex machine learning requires developers to have depth knowledge about human health, related technologies and how they can work together to achieve the app’s purpose</li>
            <li>Our team members are studying Business bachelors, not IT - so we all struggle when it comes to identifying and choosing a technology/ tool</li>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Solution
          <ul>
            <li>Ask for further advice from peers whose major is IT and try to consult with lecturers</li>
            <li>Enhance self-learning about IT field in general and necessary technologies used for this app in specific</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">10.Group processes and communication</h2>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">Fortunately, all team members go along very well and are supportive when any of us struggle with our parts. Although we do not have a strong foundation in IT, we encourage each other to overcome the obstacles by communicating a lot. Specifically, we set up meetings via Teams at least twice a week, 1 to 2 hours per meeting to allocate tasks and discuss the assignment’s requirements. Besides, we constantly update each member’s situation via Facebook messenger private group to see how far they have progressed and are there any difficulties they have encountered so far. By keeping the strong and regular communication, we expect to minimize possible conflicts as much as possible, ensure everyone is on the right track with the group’s project idea, and most importantly, strengthen the bond among members. According to our teamwork experience, communication helps nurture harmonious relationships in which we learn to respect each other’s opinions and personalities to produce effective outcomes.</h6><br>
