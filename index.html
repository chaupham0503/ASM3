      <p class="w3-justify w3-col m7 w3-right w3-padding ">My name is Tran Thi Thuy Tien, and my student ID is 3825458. Currently, I am studying Human Resources Management (HRM) in RMIT university. Personally, I am an extrovert, loving to expand my networking and making new friends who share the same interests. As A result, I have joined many clubs, and now I am a member of RMIT Human Development Club. 
    </p>
      <br>
      <p class="w3-justify w3-col m7 w3-right w3-padding ">My interest in IT began when I attended an online event centered on how technology will impact HRM in the future. That's when I learned how important technical knowledge and data analysis are if I'm going to be successful in my future career. Furthermore, the name of our team is linked to two of my current passions: business and information technology, with a desire to build and support other businesses with IT solutions in the future.

      <p class="w3-justify w3-col m7 w3-left w3-padding">My name is Pham Minh Chau and my student number is s3757313. I am a 21-year-old girl who desires to work as a marketer. As a result, RMIT is my preferred destination since its Digital Marketing program excels at combining academics with hands-on experience.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="w3-justify w3-col m7 w3-left w3-padding">Another reason I study Digital Marketing is that I've always had a fascination with technology, which is why I chose a degree that blends marketing and technology. I see myself as a person who is both creative and practical, as well as a quick and diligent learner who is not afraid of change. In addition to studies, I applied for many jobs in order to expand my abilities and expertise. Working as an intern for a well-known Digital & Creative Marketing agency, where I had the opportunity to collaborate with coworkers to use digital platforms and technology to support marketing strategies such as designing, developing, and coding websites, producing and rendering video, and so on, is one of my proudest achievements. The 6-month internship has driven my desire to learn more about the IT industry, as I recognize that marketing without technology would fail to wow customers and impact their purchasing decisions. I intend to broaden my knowledge of IT and its use in our daily lives by participating in this course.</p>

Currently, I am a final-year Logistics and Supply Chain Management student at RMIT. I consider myself to be a person who is outgoing and active, as well as someone who is forward-thinking. As a first-year student, I was able to demonstrate this through my involvement in two student clubs, AIESEC and RMIT Business Club. 
    </p>
      <br>
      <p class="w3-justify w3-col m7 w3-right w3-padding ">In terms of my IT preferences, I'm particularly interested in neural networks and artificial intelligence (AI) in the IT field. This interest arose from an RMIT "Business IT" course in which I was given an assignment to conduct extensive study into the application of demand planning in the furniture industry. As a result, that assignment piqued my curiosity in how demand forecasting and demand sensing are used in a variety of businesses and in everyday life. Because I lack IT expertise, I am doing my best to absorb additional IT information through the usage of IT-related courses available on LinkedIn library or Cousera before attempting to work in the IT field.

      <p class="w3-justify w3-col m7 w3-left w3-padding">During the semester break after the second semester of 2021 finished, I began exploring and designing my career path. I purposefully viewed the video of Tinh Te's workshop on the Data Analytics career path during the first week of semester break. Despite the fact that I have never studied information technology before, I find it fascinating, particularly the data element. As a result, I'm studying to become a Business Analyst.

<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION (PENDING) -->
<div class="w3-black">
  <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-64" style="max-width:1000px" id="project">
      <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h2>

      <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">DETAILED DESCRTIPTION</h2>
      <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">1.Overview</h2>
    
        <span><strong>Topic</strong></span>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">The concept of our project is collected from the idea of assignment 1 of Tien and Chau, two of our members. In the first assignment, Tien offered an app that would provide home training routines and healthy meals to people who cannot afford gym memberships, allowing them to lose weight at home rather than visiting public locations, which could be dangerous in the event of a COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, Chau has developed a platform called 'Smart Health Prediction,' which allows patients to input their health issues so that AI can forecast their existing disease status and provide relevant advice.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">However, because the field of health care encompasses a wide range of diseases, and we lack knowledge in that area. Therefore, we decided to focus our efforts on obesity. Our app will have two unique features: the 3D image feature will scan the user's body and predict which muscle groups need to be improved, and the Artificial Intelligence feature will automatically calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) - a weight-to-height ratio that can be used to determine whether a person is overweight or underweight - based on the users' current weight and height input.</h6><br>

        <br>
        <span><strong>Motivation</strong></span>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Our team's dedication to this project originates from our concern for people's health. We are still young and have countless opportunities to exercise in order to improve our health, rather than lying in bed or sitting in one spot for long periods of time - which is just as bad as smoking (Better Health Channel n.d.). Being passive over an incredibly long time can lead to obesity, chronic health problems, and even cancers (Better Health Channel n.d.).</h6><br>
        <br>
        <span><strong>Landscape</strong></span>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">In the healthcare mobile application industry, few applications focus on the obesity people. Instead, many applications will provide the user with interactions with doctors and explain the users' symptoms, such as Better Help and Teladoc. Regarding nutrition, the market has Generis: DNA & Nutrition application. Specifically, only MySugr – Diabetes Tracker Log is an application that will track the diabetes journey of clients. However, none of these apps can combine all of the features that MyFitnessPal provides.</h6><br>

        <h6 class="w3-justify">With MyFitnessPal, our application has five different features. First, Body scanning using 3D technology: use a phone camera for both operation IOS and Android to identify which part has the most fat in the body. Second, a BMI calculator using AI technology: have two methods to input the information. First method, users input height and weight manually. Another method is using AI technology to calculate BMI by facial image.  Third, Suggested exercise for users using AI Technology: after collecting body scanning and BMI measurements, users can create their workout program or use the suggested exercises appropriate for their body. Fourth, Meal planning using AI technology: this features help users track the amoun of calories intake for a day which is the most critical element to control weights. Besides the main features, our team also provides one more unique feature: Fitness communities. The place where users can share their achievements or milestones on the journey of losing weight, share their meal recipe with personalized ingredients with other users, or simply it is just a place for everyone to find new friends and workout mates. This feature emerges since we know that getting in shape, explicitly escaping obesity, is a challenging journey. Therefore, this fitness community purposely motivates users to achieve their goals.</h6><br>
        <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">2.Aims</h2>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Nowadays, with an year-by-year acceleration in the overweight Vietnamese population, this is defined as an alerting signal for all of us to have awareness of serious diseases derived from obesity (i.e. they could be high risk of stroke, heart disease and several cancers etc), which in turn negatively impact our quality-of life, self-image and even self-esteem (Branson n.d.). Since we - our team are generation Z - who honestly do not pay attention too much to our health and exercises, we have together created this project with the aim to create incentives for everyone to have an active engagement in mitigating the risk of obesity as well as creating a healthy lifestyle. Specifically, we believe that this app could be acted as an initial step to help people gain a basic guideline of preventing obesity through the provision of appropriate standardized exercises and nutritious meal plan.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Regarding the first goal of our project, we desire to build a user-friendly mobile app which is easy to use/ implement by users and still ensure to satisfy the customers’ requirements about this app. In fact, we consider our app as an “all-service” app due to our provision of the fully user journey ranging from calculating BMI, detecting obesity, offering exercises, offering meal plans to having a social fitness. Therefore, having a successful, user-friendly app is our first goal. </h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">In terms of the second goal, we want to make sure the accuracy of our provided result towards the body scanning, BMI calculator and having or not-having obesity decision. Since our app directly relates to people’s health, we have to follow absolute (100%) accuracy. This is not only about our reputation but also about medical ethics.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">On the other hand, we also have another goal which is building a fitness community for our app users. We believe that through establishing social interaction, users could enhance their fitness motivations as they could together share their concerned obesity-related topics or even their specific milestones of this fitness-journey.</h6><br>

        <br>
        <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">3.Plan and Progress</h2>
        <h3 class="w3-justify"><b>Plan</b></h3>

        <h4 class="w3-justify"><b>The inspiration of our project (FitnessPal)</b></h4>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">We have come up with the ideas of this project in an accident way. In the first meeting, all of the team-members together discussed the feasible ideas and we in order showed our ideas presented in assignment 1. After taking a look at four assignments which intrinsically have its potentiality and engagement, we have thought about the mixture, the combination of our ideas. We believe that our final fully complete idea is totally able to take advantage of the interesting points from our assignment 1. As a result, our idea is shaped from the idea of Tien and Chau since they have discussed weight loss apps and fitness apps consecutively. Indeed, we have identified a close-knit relationship between these health-related apps and this is defined as a plus point for us to choose this combined idea. More emphasis, we are also the young generation who have a tendency to pay less attention to our health; therefore, we define ourselves as target users who honestly need this kind of app. All in all, a FitnessPal which is perceived as an “all-service” app has been researched and developed by our Business IT team.</h6><br>
        <h4 class="w3-justify"><b>Researching, Consulting, Ready and Testing stage</b></h4>

        <h6 class="w3-justify">Before launching our app, all of the team members are aware of the complication and complexities of this project; therefore, we have decided to simplify our development process into a 4-step plan which consists of researching, consulting, readying and testing in order to ensure the performance, quality and efficiency. After finalizing the idea (which I have mentioned in the above part), this is our first task which is reading and researching health apps as a reference. Besides, alongside with the process of reading the IT concepts in general and computational methods in specific, we also began to consult with some IT professionals about the pros and cons of this app (FitnessPal) as well as any room for improvement. Next, in the ready-stage which is also called the development phase, it is decided that we will split up our team into 2 smaller teams called technical team and content team. There are two reasons for this division. The first reason is that each member of the team would have their strengths and weaknesses when it comes to developing an app; for example , Nguyen would be a more technical-oriented one when Chau majors in Marketing, meaning that she could be effectively in charge of building content and other activities required to launch the app. Finally, the testing stage is also important due to the fact that it once decides the operational feasibility of our app. In this phase we also built a prototype to get feedback from users. In brief, all of these phases would be illustrated more detailed in the “Progress” section below.</h6><br>

        <h3 class="w3-justify"><b>Progess</b></h3>
        
        <h4 class="w3-justify"><b>Researching & Consulting phases</b></h4>

        <h5 class="w3-justify"><u>a. Researching</u></h5>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">When it comes to this initial essential phase, since this would be a strong foundation for us to keep executing the onwards phase, we have to research carefully and detail. As a result, we have raised these kinds of questions and then we ourselves tried to find out the answers on our own. We believe that having the answers would help us have a better understanding and preparation of what we have to do next.</h6><br>
        <li>What are the famous and reliable health apps currently in the marketplace?</li>
        <li>What are their main features or services provided for end-users?</li>
        <li>Pick top 5-ranking apps on Appstore/ Google Play and then take a look at their mobile app as well as identify each strengths and weaknesses of these apps under the end-users’perspective</li>

        <h6 class="w3-justify">After receiving the answers, we started to raise one concern which is about the scope of this project. It is commented to be large and cover too many areas of a health app. Therefore, we have changed our initial plan to only cover obesity. As a result, we raise the two following questions to support our idea.</h6><br>
        <li>Is there any app in the marketplace focusing on only obesity?</li>
        <li>If yes, let’s research deeply about its outstanding features that we could learn and have inspiration from them. If not, based on question 3, list down the potential features/ services from other health apps in which we could put those features into our app (FitnessPal).</li>
        
        <h5 class="w3-justify"><u>b. Consulting</u></h5>

        <h6 class="w3-justify">After completing our primary research, we began to consult some IT professionals for their advice and their point of view. We are aware of the important role of this phase from the beginning since these would enable us to run our project more smoothly and lead to better results based on the prior experiences of our mentors, our IT seniors. We have contacted them in many ways via email, Microsoft team and even social media. There are some mentors that we have approached through the private groups about IT expertise on Facebook, and they are very willing to listen to our ideas and give feedback. More emphasis, with the meetings occurring through the Microsoft team, we also ask for their permission to record it and then when it comes to our group meeting, we play it, taking note for the preparation of the development phase. 
          After careful consideration, we came to the conclusion that there would be 4 features included in our app which are Body scanning, BMI calculator, Suggested exercise and Meal planning.</h6><br>

        <h4 class="w3-justify"><b>Development phase</b></h4>
        <h5 class="w3-justify"><u>a. Designing a draft broad mobile app based on other health mobile apps’ design</u></h5>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">In our opinion, this sub-phase required the combination of both content team and technical team. Further explained, we need to seamlessly integrate these aforementioned functionalities into the project and simultaneously, a draft about general mobile app design is required to be easily visualized and make all combined elements uniform.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Firstly, our content team (Châu and Tiên) worked together to build a checklist of necessary functions on the website as well as the requirements that end-users would like to require when downloading our FitnessPal app. We believe that in order to stay-ahead of the rivals, we have to establish a user-friendly and effective interface (UI); consequently, a detailed and organized plan is indispensable. Therefore, this draft would act as a strong base for us to design a mobile app which successfully contains the most crucial and complete features. To illustrate, we will take the figure below as a reference since it relatively resembles our checklist in this phase.</h6>
  
        <img src="qd.jpg" class="w3-center w3-square" alt="IT picture" style="width:100%">
        <br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Alongside the preparation from the content team, the technical team (Huy and Nguyên) come to the stage of deciding appropriate ML algorithms to serve our provided services. We have to say that this task is a very challenging and time-consuming task since all of the team members have majors in Business. After researching the feasible ones and consulting with IT seniors, we have decided the optimal one which is medical diagnosis - support vector machines. Besides, the technical team is in charge of building wireframes to offer outlines and visual appearance. Our specific timeline would be illustrated in more detail in the below section. To illustrate, we will take the figure below as a reference since it could potentially reflect what technical has to do in this phase.</h6><br>
        <img src="a.jpg" class="w3-center w3-square" alt="IT picture" style="width:100%">
        <br>

        <h6 class="w3-justify">In brief, in this sub-phase, we together created a particular draft to arrange the position of headers, footers and function-keys reasonably. We want to make sure that users can have the best experience when interacting with our app. Indeed, this draft plays a dispensable part in effectively visualising all elements and pointing out areas that need improvement for following steps.</h6><br>
        <h5 class="w3-justify"><u>b. Developing our final mobile app</u></h5>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">For our Business IT team, this is my first-time that my group is exposed to a real industry in terms of the information-technology field. We are also aware that with the current IT knowledge of all team members, executing this project with minimal errors took us a lot of effort especially in the mobile app coding process. We have spent much time researching the possible tools supporting mobile app development. At the end, we came to the agreement that Visual Studio code would be deployed to build our mobile application. The first reason is that we have time to get familiar with Visual Studio Code through the requirement of GitHub assignment. The second reason is its advantages in building apps for both Android, iOS.</h6><br>
        <h4 class="w3-justify"><b>Testing phase</b></h4>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">In this phase, we will mainly focus on functional testing since it would determine if the functionalities of our mobile application could work as expected with the predetermined requirement specifications. Some necessary validations that our team need to conduct in this phase are:</h6><br>

            <li>Installing the mobile application</li>
            <li>Fields-testing</li>
            <li>Update-testing</li>
            <li>Device-resources testing</li>
            <br>
     
            <h6 class="w3-justify">Besides, usability testing is needed to ensure the most convenient interaction between app and customers. By applying Focus Group testing, we could give them our prototype and then collect their feedback based on 3 main criterias:</h6><br>
                <li>Effectiveness</li>
                <li>Efficiency</li>

      <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">5.Scope and Limits</h2>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">A scope of work (SOW) of a project is important as it defines what will be included as a part of our project and what is not, and also the boundaries of the project (Toucan 2020). Therefore, the Business IT team will provide a specific scope statement about the purpose of this project, what we want to create and how to accomplish it.</h6><br>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">Overall, this project is to create a mobile application - which can be functioned on both iOS and Android mobile devices - to raise awareness about doing workout and obesity. For better illustration of how our mobile application will help Vietnamese people, we have built our desired product's prototype on Figma. To know more about login function, the app's settings, etc please visit this link:</h6><br>

      </a>
      <br>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">The project will produces four main different features that strongly motivates Vietnamese to move and not being inactive: body scanning, meal planning, BMI calculation and automatical exercises suggested. In particular, one more feature is considered to be developed in the future - building a fitness community on the application.</h6><br>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">Body Scanning (3D technology): users will turn on their front camera of smartphones to scan their body shapes, with some simple movement - so that the technology can scan different angles and produce digital body models that represent the user's body shapes. Moreover, users can zoom in, zoom out, rotate to identify which part of their body contains the most fat. There will also be a historical data section - where users can keep track of their progress by comparing their past, current and future body shapes.

      <h6 class="w3-justify">
      <h6 class="w3-justify">
      <h6 class="w3-justify">BMI Calculator (AI Technology): our app will collect the Body Mass Index (BMI) of users to assess the probability of overweight through two ways:</h6><br>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">Users will manually input their weight/ height and the system will automatically calculate the BMI for further comparison.</h6><br>

      <h6 class="w3-justify">
      <h6 class="w3-justify">4. Meal planning (AI technology): according to our research, in order to lose weight, a suitable exercise is not enough, and a reasonable meal planning is very important (NHS n.d.). The most important principle for a person who wants to lose weight is they must control their “calories in smaller than calories out” - it means we have to eat less calories and move more. Therefore, our app will enable users to input the amount of food they are going to eat, and the app will calculate the calories equivalent to that amount of food - so that users can easily track their calorie intake. </h6><br>
      <img src="UI meal.JPG" class="w3-left w3-square" alt="IT picture" style="width:50%">
      <img src="UI meall.JPG" class="w3-right w3-square" alt="IT picture" style="width:50%">
      <h6 class="w3-justify">5. Fitness communities (still-in-consideration function): based on psychological research about physical excercise, people tend to enjoy their activities when they are doing it with a group of friends, or a community that shares the same interests, rather than taking exercise alone (Edwards 2003). Therefore, we aim to create a function that is like a social platform, where users can share their milestones, achievements in terms of fitness and sport, or find a friend that motivates and encourages them to take physical activity. </h6><br>
      <img src="UI fitt.JPG" class="w3-left w3-square" alt="IT picture" style="width:50%">
      <img src="UI fit.JPG" class="w3-right w3-square" alt="IT picture" style="width:50%">

      <h6 class="w3-justify">Besides, our target audience is people who are struggling with being overweight but do not know where to start, or students, adults who have low income that can not afford gym membership fees to download our application as a real coach for their exercise target. </h6>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">With each of the features, the Business IT team will carefully manage the process and problems, with tools to track the progress and productive collaboration in order to satisfy future stakeholders. However, we consider the body scanning feature using the 3D technology would be a time-consuming process for the team that have just started to study about IT, lacking formal knowledge like the Business IT team. According to Golovnya (2020), in order to create the three-dimensional scanning, the team must take into account the C++ for application development, or working on 3D rendering time, etc. However, none of us have ever tried C++ programming, while 3D rendering is a memory intensive process that would be time-consuming for beginners like the Business IT team - about 1-2 months for a beginner to learn about the process before starting out (Snellen 2021). Besides limited human resources, there is also limited time for building this application (which will be analyzed in the time frame section). Therefore, the 3D body scanning function is showing the risk of uncertainty, while the three other functions using AI technology will be examined and implemented for the user interface of the team’s application, but with minimum ability and the team will try to gradually remove bugs, software updates, etc. </h6><br>
      <li>Limitations:
      <h6 class="w3-justify">1. Technical knowledge limitations:</h6>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">As stated above, the Business IT team members are all freshmen when it comes to the field of IT, therefore, the technical knowledge such as coding, fixing bugs, etc still have not fully comprehended by the team members, mainly due to time constraint. Therefore, in order to complete our project idea, members in the team have to continue research and analyse the UI & UX design, device compatibility, PR and digital marketing, etc to successfully launch this application. Without a proper plan of learning about programming language, the team could end up losing so much time, effort and all the fascinating expectation is drained out of it.</h6><br>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">2. Design limitations: </h6>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">The screen size of websites and mobile applications is very different from each other: the mobile screen is much smaller than PC or laptop screen, and also the pointing tool is not the same size (for mobile applications is the user's finger, which is much larger than the mouse pointer of PC or laptop). During the process of buidling UI & UX strategy of the Business IT team, the screen resolution, pixel densities, etc is estimated to be time-consuming because we will have to conduct application test over and over again until the application is fit the screen efficiency standard, or until the application is not gobble-up too much battery power of the phone. Thus, we are intending to seek support from other professional mobile application developers - to save time for building this project and avoid faulty functionality. </h6><br>
      <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">6. Tools and technologies:</h2>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">Based on the functionality of this mobile application, the tools and technologies for our project will be divided into two aspects: Artificial Intelligence (with Machine Learning algorithms) and 3D technologies. The detailed description about these two technologies have been examined in previous assignments, therefore, in this section, the tools & technologies that needed to build the structure of the application and to design the user interface will be examined. </h6><br>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">Regarding the tools for the design functionality of our mobile application, the Business IT team chose UML, Python with a hope to create a professional and eye-catching outlook for the application. Moreover, the ANDROMO platform will also be utilized to design the user interface, and develop our application that can be downloaded from both Android and iOS mobile devices</h6><br>
      <img src="andromo.JPG" class="w3-middle w3-square" alt="IT picture" style="width:100%">
      <h6 class="w3-justify">Our team member - Tien - has experienced trying to use this platform to build her project idea from Assignment 1. According to Tien, ANDROMO is a very user-friendly platform that any mobile application developer could consider when they first started to build the project on their own. ANDROMO provides various templates of user interface for developers to design or to modify, based on their creativity and imagination. Developers only need to determine the desired theme, color, function, etc, ANDROMO will display detailed guidelines on how to build a perfect mobile application. Therefore, this platform is recommended for any mobile application developers, even for the non-technical developers.</h6><br>
      <img src="andromoo.JPG" class="w3-middle w3-square" alt="IT picture" style="width:100%">
      <h6 class="w3-justify">In the future, regarding the development of 3D tools, Business IT chose to use Application Programming Interface (API) - an intermediary software that helps us create seamless connection between the application and user’s smartphones. Secondly, in order to re-create the physical objects on the application (in this case the object is the user's body when they use the scanning feature), Business IT will use Photogrammetry: it is considered as a science and technology that could obtain real-world objects into 3D models, by measuring and interpreting images (Ebert 2015). Finally, React 360 is utilized for our 3D application, which assists the team to build 3D models with interactive and easy-to-use interface.</h6><br>
      <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">7. Testings:</h2>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">a. UI testing:</h6>
      <li>A/B testing (split-testing or bucket testing):</li>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">Our team will develop hypotheses, then, execute an experiment that has variant A and variant B modules on different segments of the audience to identify which module of variant brings the best result. This test would help us to optimize engagements of users when using our app, examine what design is preferred by our target audience and discover the impact and effectiveness of our features (Verhoeven 2019). </h6><br>
      <li>Usability testing:</li>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">Including customer experience testing - to ensure that our user and clients are satisfied with the design, the color palette of the apps. Moreover, functional, performance and load testing will also be taken into account: this is to test if the login, logout function have any crash, bugs, or the network will also be tested using API performance testing method. </h6><br>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">Compatibility testing:</h2>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">This test is divided into two types: backward testing and forward testing - to make sure that our application is working properly and efficiently on mobile phone version, before moving on to different device designs such as tablet, iPad, etc in the future (Charter Global 2020). </h6><br>





      <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">8.Timeframe</h2>

      <h6 class="w3-justify">After submitting assignment 2, our team started spending the last 4 weeks of this semester working on the last assignment, which includes a report, a website demo on Github and a presentation. Because this is a group project, we all decided that everyone will be involved in all the tasks, starting from meetings to finalizing the report, demo website and presentation slides. By doing this, all teammates can understand the assignment’s requirements, the purpose of our project idea and how it will be executed in real-life. Furthermore, we want to strengthen the collaboration among team members and hope that everyone can contribute equally to the final result.</h6><br>

      <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">9.Risks</h2>
      
      <h4 class="w3-justify"><b>Poor UX/ UI integration</b></h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Cause
          <ul>
            <li>UI: not enough research go into the wireframe development that leads to unfriendly-user interface, lack of aesthetic attraction and hard for users to navigate lack</li>
            <li>UX: Wrong choice of the servers, data diagrams, APIs that leads to poor functionality</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Solution
          <ul>
            <li>UI: keep the app’s design simple, interactive with easy-to-absorb and consistent content. This could be solved by doing thorough research about the target audience to understand which features, functions they need from the moment they start logging our app until they get the needed data to help manage weight.</li>
            <li>UX: be careful when building the wireframe that correctly maps to each stage of the customer journey, test several times before final releasing</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="w3-justify"><b>Unreliable content</b></h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Cause
          <ul>
            <li>With many misleading articles on the Internet, each piece of content published on the app needs to be accurate and reliable for users to follow. For example, outdated diet plans that adversely affect health should be avoided</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Solution
          <ul>
            <li>Careful research about human’s health in general</li>
            <li>Follow WHO’s data as a standard information for credibility</li>
            <li>Take reference from nutritionists, doctors, health advisors, personal trainers when suggesting meal recipes and exercise plans</li>

            <li>UX: be careful when building the wireframe that correctly maps to each stage of the customer journey, test several times before final releasing</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="w3-justify"><b>Inaccurate body scanner</b></h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Cause
          <ul>
            <li> wrong measurements resulted from the user's position and whether they are placing the back camera correctly, as well as technical issues might occur.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Solution
          <ul>
            <li>Providing informative and easy guidance with demo video showing users how to self-scan at home and how to interpret BMI ratios appeared after scanning.</li>
            <li>Implementing preventive application maintenance to help ensure data security</li>
            <li>Use simple-to-understand functions to enhance personalized monitoring to increase ease of use and boost users’ experience</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="w3-justify"><b>Security violation</b></h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Cause
          <ul>
            <li>Implementing unauthorized data storage systems, databases, inadequate encryption algorithms that are easy to be hacked. As people’s health is a sensitive issue, poor choice of user data protection can lead to an exposure of data to third parties for illegal purposes.</li>
            <li>Inadequate IT knowledge when choosing security technologies</li>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Solution
          <ul>
            <li>Understand thoroughly about privacy guidelines from Vietnamese government and invest in the most innovative security technologies</li>
            <li>Have a section about data policy and be transparent about how users’ data will be used</li>
            <li>Give users control over data the app collects</li>

      <h4 class="w3-justify"><b>Inadequate knowledge & skills</b></h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Cause
          <ul>
            <li>This weight control mobile application integrates both 3D technology, AI and complex machine learning requires developers to have depth knowledge about human health, related technologies and how they can work together to achieve the app’s purpose</li>
            <li>Our team members are studying Business bachelors, not IT - so we all struggle when it comes to identifying and choosing a technology/ tool</li>

      <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">10.Group processes and communication</h2>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">Fortunately, all team members go along very well and are supportive when any of us struggle with our parts. Although we do not have a strong foundation in IT, we encourage each other to overcome the obstacles by communicating a lot. Specifically, we set up meetings via Teams at least twice a week, 1 to 2 hours per meeting to allocate tasks and discuss the assignment’s requirements. Besides, we constantly update each member’s situation via Facebook messenger private group to see how far they have progressed and are there any difficulties they have encountered so far. By keeping the strong and regular communication, we expect to minimize possible conflicts as much as possible, ensure everyone is on the right track with the group’s project idea, and most importantly, strengthen the bond among members. According to our teamwork experience, communication helps nurture harmonious relationships in which we learn to respect each other’s opinions and personalities to produce effective outcomes.</h6><br>

      <li>Tran Thi Thuy Tien
        <h6 class="w3-justify">In this last assignment, my and my teammate have learned about how to manage our time reasonably - to finish the assignment on time. All my three course assignments are due on week 12, so I was really afraid that I might not accomplish all the tasks of written report, research about my part, and preparing slides and script for our presentation. However, thanks to all my three collaborative members in the team - has supported and motivated me to finish the deadline on time.</h6>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">I am really grateful that the teamwork process of our group members went well, with no conflicts or disagreement. Nevertheless, I believed that our presentation could have been more successful if we built the prototype to illustrate our project’s function better. Unfortunately, at the time we submitted the presentation slides, all of our group members were too busy doing other assignments, therefore, we had to find other applications' functions to illustrate for our project. Moving on to the report, I am very happy and excited when our team finished building the prototype (as presented above), to be more descriptive when it comes to our project. </h6>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Regarding Github activities, we were all fluently used this platform in this second assignment, not having much trouble and time-consuming issues like when we were doing it in the first assignment. Therefore, all of our team members have equally contributed their part into Github’s repository, and finished on time. </h6>

          <h6 class="w3-justify">It has been a great 12 weeks to collaborate with amazing teammates to create and build an IT-related project idea. Considering the fact that all of our team members are from School of Business, I believe we have done a good job in trying to understand IT concepts, design tools and languages, different types of machine learning algorithms, artificial intelligence, and especially learning about possible risks associated with these technology as well as solutions to prevent those risks. Therefore, each week of the semester we attempted to upgrade our knowledge and skill a little bit, to fully be prepared for the last assignment.</h6>
          <h6 class="w3-justify">To achieve this, we always try to enhance communication among all team members through regular team meetings (both online and offline) to timely identify problems or difficulties that some members might encounter. Accordingly, we were successful in minimising unnecessary conflicts that could sabotage our relationships.</h6>
          <h6 class="w3-justify">Another thing that made me proud of my team is their ability to invest devotedly to the assignment and complete their allocated tasks in a timely and efficient manner despite insufficient IT experience and busy schedule. Specifically, I am grateful to have Nguyen as the group’s ‘IT professional’, who is not only hardworking but also never hesitates to research IT technology to help us with the Github and artefact parts. Also, Tien and Huy are among the most supportive, polite and helpful teammates that I have ever met. The three of them, together, have made this course become a memorable journey of my last semester at RMIT.</h6>
