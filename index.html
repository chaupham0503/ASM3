      <p class="w3-justify w3-col m7 w3-right w3-padding ">My name is Tran Thi Thuy Tien, and my student ID is 3825458. Presently, I am majoring in Human Resources Management (HRM) at RMIT university. I am an extrovert that really enjoys making new friends, therefore, I joined many clubs, such as RMIT Human Development Club which enables me to develop interpersonal skills and meet friends who share mutual interests. My enjoyment for IT started when I attended an online event that focused on how IT will affect HRM in the future. That’s when I realized the importance of technical skill and data analysis if I want to succeed with my future career path. Moreover, our team’s name is related to two of my interests right now: business and IT - with a desire to create and support other businesses with IT solutions in the future.

Therefore, RMIT is my destination as its Digital Marketing degree integrates both academic and hands-on practice excellently. Another reason I study Digital Marketing is because I always have a soft spot for technology, which explains why I chose a major which combines both marketing and technology. I consider myself as a creative yet logical person as well as a quick and diligent learner who is not afraid to embrace changes. Besides studying, I also applied for several jobs to nurture skills and knowledge. One of my proudest jobs is working as an intern for a famous Digital & Creative Marketing agency, in which I had the opportunity to collaborate with co-workers to use digital platforms and technology to support marketing strategies such as design, develop and code website, produce and render video, etc. The 6-month internship has fueled my motivation to explore more about the IT world, as I acknowledge marketing without technology will fail to impress the consumers and influence their buying behaviour. By enrolling in this course, I hope to broaden my knowledge about IT knowledge and its application in our daily lives.</p>

Currently, I am a final year student in RMIT with a major in Logistics & Supply chain management. I define myself as an outgoing and energetic person; besides, I am an progesstive person This could be illustrated clearly through my participation in two student clubs which are AIESEC and RMIT Business Club when I am a first-year student. Talking about my IT preference, I am super interested in neural networks and artificial intelligence (AI) in the IT industry. This interest originated from a “Business IT” course in RMIT in which I was given an assignment to research deeply about the application of demand planning in a furniture enterprise. Therefore, that assignment actually triggered my interest in how demand forecasting and demand sensing are applied in many industries in daily life. Since I still do not have any IT experience, I am trying my best to absorb more IT knowledge through the provision of IT-related courses on LinkedIn library or Cousera before having a chance to step into the IT working industry.

With that ID, every student can access every facility in RMIT. Since the second semester of 2021 ended, I started exploring and designing my career path during semester break. During the first week of semester break, I intentionally watched the video of Tinh Te’s workshop discussing the Data Analytics career path. Although I have not approached Information Technology before, I find it interesting, especially the Data aspect. Therefore, I am preparing to become a Business Analyst.

Otherwise, I'm a Tactile learner who's willing to dive into the project more than just discussing a subject. Especially in IT, consulting and ready theory to find a solution are just not enough. Digging while doing something is the best way to find the error and directly fix it. Therefore, it could be a positive trait for me to work in a team. Finally, the openness score shows me as a person that thinks in a sophisticated and complex idea. However, I think it could be a good point in teamwork. With a broad way of thinking, I can gather all of the necessary information for the work.

<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION (PENDING) -->
<div class="w3-black">
  <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-64" style="max-width:1000px" id="project">
      <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h2>

      <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">DETAILED DESCRTIPTION</h2>
      <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">1.Overview</h2>
    
        <span><strong>Topic</strong></span>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">The concept of our project is collected from the idea of assignment 1 of Tien and Chau, two of our members. In the first assignment, Tien offered an app that would provide home training routines and healthy meals to people who cannot afford gym memberships, allowing them to lose weight at home rather than visiting public locations, which could be dangerous in the event of a COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, Chau has developed a platform called 'Smart Health Prediction,' which allows patients to input their health issues so that AI can forecast their existing disease status and provide relevant advice.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">However, because the field of health care encompasses a wide range of diseases, and we lack knowledge in that area. Therefore, we decided to focus our efforts on obesity. Our app will have two unique features: the 3D image feature will scan the user's body and predict which muscle groups need to be improved, and the Artificial Intelligence feature will automatically calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) - a weight-to-height ratio that can be used to determine whether a person is overweight or underweight - based on the users' current weight and height input.</h6><br>

        <br>
        <span><strong>Motivation</strong></span>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Our team's dedication to this project originates from our concern for people's health. We are still young and have countless opportunities to exercise in order to improve our health, rather than lying in bed or sitting in one spot for long periods of time - which is just as bad as smoking (Better Health Channel n.d.). Being passive over an incredibly long time can lead to obesity, chronic health problems, and even cancers (Better Health Channel n.d.).</h6><br>
        <br>
        <span><strong>Landscape</strong></span>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">In the healthcare mobile application industry, few applications focus on the obesity people. Instead, many applications will provide the user with interactions with doctors and explain the users' symptoms, such as Better Help and Teladoc. Regarding nutrition, the market has Generis: DNA & Nutrition application. Specifically, only MySugr – Diabetes Tracker Log is an application that will track the diabetes journey of clients. However, none of these apps can combine all of the features that MyFitnessPal provides.</h6><br>

        <h6 class="w3-justify">With MyFitnessPal, our application has five different features. First, Body scanning using 3D technology: use a phone camera for both operation IOS and Android to identify which part has the most fat in the body. Second, a BMI calculator using AI technology: have two methods to input the information. First method, users input height and weight manually. Another method is using AI technology to calculate BMI by facial image.  Third, Suggested exercise for users using AI Technology: after collecting body scanning and BMI measurements, users can create their workout program or use the suggested exercises appropriate for their body. Fourth, Meal planning using AI technology: this features help users track the amoun of calories intake for a day which is the most critical element to control weights. Besides the main features, our team also provides one more unique feature: Fitness communities. The place where users can share their achievements or milestones on the journey of losing weight, share their meal recipe with personalized ingredients with other users, or simply it is just a place for everyone to find new friends and workout mates. This feature emerges since we know that getting in shape, explicitly escaping obesity, is a challenging journey. Therefore, this fitness community purposely motivates users to achieve their goals.</h6><br>
        <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">2.Aims</h2>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Nowadays, with an year-by-year acceleration in the overweight Vietnamese population, this is defined as an alerting signal for all of us to have awareness of serious diseases derived from obesity (i.e. they could be high risk of stroke, heart disease and several cancers etc), which in turn negatively impact our quality-of life, self-image and even self-esteem (Branson n.d.). Since we - our team are generation Z - who honestly do not pay attention too much to our health and exercises, we have together created this project with the aim to create incentives for everyone to have an active engagement in mitigating the risk of obesity as well as creating a healthy lifestyle. Specifically, we believe that this app could be acted as an initial step to help people gain a basic guideline of preventing obesity through the provision of appropriate standardized exercises and nutritious meal plan.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Regarding the first goal of our project, we desire to build a user-friendly mobile app which is easy to use/ implement by users and still ensure to satisfy the customers’ requirements about this app. In fact, we consider our app as an “all-service” app due to our provision of the fully user journey ranging from calculating BMI, detecting obesity, offering exercises, offering meal plans to having a social fitness. Therefore, having a successful, user-friendly app is our first goal. </h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">In terms of the second goal, we want to make sure the accuracy of our provided result towards the body scanning, BMI calculator and having or not-having obesity decision. Since our app directly relates to people’s health, we have to follow absolute (100%) accuracy. This is not only about our reputation but also about medical ethics.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">On the other hand, we also have another goal which is building a fitness community for our app users. We believe that through establishing social interaction, users could enhance their fitness motivations as they could together share their concerned obesity-related topics or even their specific milestones of this fitness-journey.</h6><br>

        <br>
        <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">3.Plan and Progress</h2>
        <li>Plan
          <br>
          <span>The inspiration of our project (FitnessPal)</span>
          <h6 class="w3-justify">We have come up with the ideas of this project in an accident way. In the first meeting, all of the team-members together discussed the feasible ideas and we in order showed our ideas presented in assignment 1. After taking a look at four assignments which intrinsically have its potentiality and engagement, we have thought about the mixture, the combination of our ideas. We believe that our final fully complete idea is totally able to take advantage of the interesting points from our assignment 1. As a result, our idea is shaped from the idea of Tien and Chau since they have discussed weight loss apps and fitness apps consecutively. Indeed, we have identified a close-knit relationship between these health-related apps and this is defined as a plus point for us to choose this combined idea. More emphasis, we are also the young generation who have a tendency to pay less attention to our health; therefore, we define ourselves as target users who honestly need this kind of app. All in all, a FitnessPal which is perceived as an “all-service” app has been researched and developed by our Business IT team.</h6><br>

          <span>Researching, Consulting, Ready and Testing stage</span>

        <h6 class="w3-justify">Before launching our app, all of the team members are aware of the complication and complexities of this project; therefore, we have decided to simplify our development process into a 4-step plan which consists of researching, consulting, readying and testing in order to ensure the performance, quality and efficiency. After finalizing the idea (which I have mentioned in the above part), this is our first task which is reading and researching health apps as a reference. Besides, alongside with the process of reading the IT concepts in general and computational methods in specific, we also began to consult with some IT professionals about the pros and cons of this app (FitnessPal) as well as any room for improvement. Next, in the ready-stage which is also called the development phase, it is decided that we will split up our team into 2 smaller teams called technical team and content team. There are two reasons for this division. The first reason is that each member of the team would have their strengths and weaknesses when it comes to developing an app; for example , Nguyen would be a more technical-oriented one when Chau majors in Marketing, meaning that she could be effectively in charge of building content and other activities required to launch the app. Finally, the testing stage is also important due to the fact that it once decides the operational feasibility of our app. In this phase we also built a prototype to get feedback from users. In brief, all of these phases would be illustrated more detailed in the “Progress” section below.</h6><br>

        <li>Progress
          <br>

          <span><b>Researching & Consulting phases</b></span>
          <br>

          <span><u>a.Researching</u></span>
          <h6 class="w3-justify">When it comes to this initial essential phase, since this would be a strong foundation for us to keep executing the onwards phase, we have to research carefully and detail. As a result, we have raised these kinds of questions and then we ourselves tried to find out the answers on our own. We believe that having the answers would help us have a better understanding and preparation of what we have to do next.</h6><br>
            <li>What are the famous and reliable health apps currently in the marketplace?</li>
            <li>What are their main features or services provided for end-users?</li>
            <li>Pick top 5-ranking apps on Appstore/ Google Play and then take a look at their mobile app as well as identify each strengths and weaknesses of these apps under the end-users’perspective</li>

          <h6 class="w3-justify">After receiving the answers, we started to raise one concern which is about the scope of this project. It is commented to be large and cover too many areas of a health app. Therefore, we have changed our initial plan to only cover obesity. As a result, we raise the two following questions to support our idea.</h6><br>
          <li>Is there any app in the marketplace focusing on only obesity?</li>
          <li>If yes, let’s research deeply about its outstanding features that we could learn and have inspiration from them. If not, based on question 3, list down the potential features/ services from other health apps in which we could put those features into our app (FitnessPal).</li>
          <br>

          <span><u>b.Consulting</u></span>

          <h6 class="w3-justify">After completing our primary research, we began to consult some IT professionals for their advice and their point of view. We are aware of the important role of this phase from the beginning since these would enable us to run our project more smoothly and lead to better results based on the prior experiences of our mentors, our IT seniors. We have contacted them in many ways via email, Microsoft team and even social media. There are some mentors that we have approached through the private groups about IT expertise on Facebook, and they are very willing to listen to our ideas and give feedback. More emphasis, with the meetings occurring through the Microsoft team, we also ask for their permission to record it and then when it comes to our group meeting, we play it, taking note for the preparation of the development phase. 
            After careful consideration, we came to the conclusion that there would be 4 features included in our app which are Body scanning, BMI calculator, Suggested exercise and Meal planning.</h6><br>

            <span><b>Development phase</b></span>
            <br>
            <span><u>a.Designing a draft broad mobile app based on other health mobile apps’ design</u></span>
            <h6 class="w3-justify">In our opinion, this sub-phase required the combination of both content team and technical team. Further explained, we need to seamlessly integrate these aforementioned functionalities into the project and simultaneously, a draft about general mobile app design is required to be easily visualized and make all combined elements uniform.</h6><br>
            <h6 class="w3-justify">Firstly, our content team (Châu and Tiên) worked together to build a checklist of necessary functions on the website as well as the requirements that end-users would like to require when downloading our FitnessPal app. We believe that in order to stay-ahead of the rivals, we have to establish a user-friendly and effective interface (UI); consequently, a detailed and organized plan is indispensable. Therefore, this draft would act as a strong base for us to design a mobile app which successfully contains the most crucial and complete features. To illustrate, we will take the figure below as a reference since it relatively resembles our checklist in this phase.</h6><br>
            <br>
 
            <img src="qd.jpg" class="w3-center w3-square" alt="IT picture" style="width:100%">
            <h6 class="w3-justify">Alongside the preparation from the content team, the technical team (Huy and Nguyên) come to the stage of deciding appropriate ML algorithms to serve our provided services. We have to say that this task is a very challenging and time-consuming task since all of the team members have majors in Business. After researching the feasible ones and consulting with IT seniors, we have decided the optimal one which is medical diagnosis - support vector machines. Besides, the technical team is in charge of building wireframes to offer outlines and visual appearance. Our specific timeline would be illustrated in more detail in the below section. To illustrate, we will take the figure below as a reference since it could potentially reflect what technical has to do in this phase.</h6><br>
            <img src="a.jpg" class="w3-center w3-square" alt="IT picture" style="width:100%">

            <h6 class="w3-justify">In brief, in this sub-phase, we together created a particular draft to arrange the position of headers, footers and function-keys reasonably. We want to make sure that users can have the best experience when interacting with our app. Indeed, this draft plays a dispensable part in effectively visualising all elements and pointing out areas that need improvement for following steps.</h6><br>
            <span><u>b. Developing our final mobile app</u></span>
            <h6 class="w3-justify">For our Business IT team, this is my first-time that my group is exposed to a real industry in terms of the information-technology field. We are also aware that with the current IT knowledge of all team members, executing this project with minimal errors took us a lot of effort especially in the mobile app coding process. We have spent much time researching the possible tools supporting mobile app development. At the end, we came to the agreement that Visual Studio code would be deployed to build our mobile application. The first reason is that we have time to get familiar with Visual Studio Code through the requirement of GitHub assignment. The second reason is its advantages in building apps for both Android, iOS.</h6><br>
            <span><b>Testing phase</b></span>
            <h6 class="w3-justify">In this phase, we will mainly focus on functional testing since it would determine if the functionalities of our mobile application could work as expected with the predetermined requirement specifications. Some necessary validations that our team need to conduct in this phase are:</h6><br>

              <li>Installing the mobile application</li>
              <li>Fields-testing</li>
              <li>Update-testing</li>
              <li>Device-resources testing</li>
              <br>
     
            <h6 class="w3-justify">Besides, usability testing is needed to ensure the most convenient interaction between app and customers. By applying Focus Group testing, we could give them our prototype and then collect their feedback based on 3 main criterias:</h6><br>
                <li>Effectiveness</li>
                <li>Efficiency</li>
                <li>Satisfaction</li>

      <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">5.Scope and Limits</h2>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">A scope of work (SOW) of a project is important as it defines what will be included as a part of our project and what is not, and also the boundaries of the project (Toucan 2020). Therefore, the Business IT team will provide a specific scope statement about the purpose of this project, what we want to create and how to accomplish it.</h6><br>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">Overall, this project is to create a mobile application - which can be functioned on both iOS and Android mobile devices - to raise awareness about doing workout and obesity. For better illustration of how our mobile application will help Vietnamese people, we have built our desired product's prototype on Figma. To know more about login function, the app's settings, etc please visit this link:</h6><br>

      <h6 class="w3-justify">The project will produces four main different features that strongly motivates Vietnamese to move and not being inactive: body scanning, meal planning, BMI calculation and automatical exercises suggested. In particular, one more feature is considered to be developed in the future - building a fitness community on the application.</h6><br>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">Body Scanning (3D technology): users will turn on their front camera of smartphones to scan their body shapes, with some simple movement - so that the technology can scan different angles and produce digital body models that represent the user's body shapes. Moreover, users can zoom in, zoom out, rotate to identify which part of their body contains the most fat. There will also be a historical data section - where users can keep track of their progress by comparing their past, current and future body shapes.

      <h6 class="w3-justify">After submitting assignment 2, our team started spending the last 4 weeks of this semester working on the last assignment, which includes a report, a website demo on Github and a presentation. Because this is a group project, we all decided that everyone will be involved in all the tasks, starting from meetings to finalizing the report, demo website and presentation slides. By doing this, all teammates can understand the assignment’s requirements, the purpose of our project idea and how it will be executed in real-life. Furthermore, we want to strengthen the collaboration among team members and hope that everyone can contribute equally to the final result.</h6><br>

      <p>Poor UX/ UI integration</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Cause
          <ul>
            <li>UI: not enough research go into the wireframe development that leads to unfriendly-user interface, lack of aesthetic attraction and hard for users to navigate lack</li>
            <li>UX: Wrong choice of the servers, data diagrams, APIs that leads to poor functionality</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Solution
          <ul>
            <li>UI: keep the app’s design simple, interactive with easy-to-absorb and consistent content. This could be solved by doing thorough research about the target audience to understand which features, functions they need from the moment they start logging our app until they get the needed data to help manage weight.</li>
            <li>UX: be careful when building the wireframe that correctly maps to each stage of the customer journey, test several times before final releasing</li>

      <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">10.Group processes and communication</h2>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">Fortunately, all team members go along very well and are supportive when any of us struggle with our parts. Although we do not have a strong foundation in IT, we encourage each other to overcome the obstacles by communicating a lot. Specifically, we set up meetings via Teams at least twice a week, 1 to 2 hours per meeting to allocate tasks and discuss the assignment’s requirements. Besides, we constantly update each member’s situation via Facebook messenger private group to see how far they have progressed and are there any difficulties they have encountered so far. By keeping the strong and regular communication, we expect to minimize possible conflicts as much as possible, ensure everyone is on the right track with the group’s project idea, and most importantly, strengthen the bond among members. According to our teamwork experience, communication helps nurture harmonious relationships in which we learn to respect each other’s opinions and personalities to produce effective outcomes.</h6><br>
